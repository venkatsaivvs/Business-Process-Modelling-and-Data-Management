Major problems in the as-is process of admitting a student in to SRM University,Chennai is that 
every step is manual and includes paper work starting from the application process throughout the 
counselling which is very slow and consuming much effort and time

The TO-BE process includes a central Database maintained by the system which usually contains the applicantâ€™s data, 
academic data and fee related data. It focusses on storing and processing (Insert, update) based on web pages. 
University can analyze and perform computations using this data. A faster responsive system performing CRUD operations 
will help in making admission and scholarship decisions quickly.
