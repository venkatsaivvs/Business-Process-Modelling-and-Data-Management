Major problems in the as-is process of admitting a student in to SRM University,Chennai is that 
every step is manual and includes paper work starting from the application process throughout the 
counselling which is very slow and consuming much effort and time

The TO-BE process includes a central Database maintained by the system which usually contains the applicant’s data, 
academic data and fee related data. It focusses on storing and processing (Insert, update) based on web pages. 
University can analyze and perform computations using this data. A faster responsive system performing CRUD operations 
will help in making admission and scholarship decisions quickly.

Impact: This will make the counselling process a hassle free one. The decision on the scholarship for a student is made available to the student on the same day. This would save a week’s time for the student. It also saves time and money for the students because they need not come to the campus. The recommended process also reduces the human effort put in to conduct and organize counselling. Since this application development is once for all, All the counselling process in the future can also make use of this application.
